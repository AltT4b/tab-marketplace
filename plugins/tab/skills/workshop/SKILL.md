description: "Collaborative planning for non-trivial decisions. Use when the user is exploring how to approach something, weighing alternatives, or expressing uncertainty about direction — even if they don't use words like 'workshop' or 'plan'. If the user seems to be thinking through a problem rather than asking for a specific action, invoke this skill. Do not answer exploratory design questions directly — use this skill to structure the thinking. Also triggers on /workshop."
argument-hint: "[idea or problem to workshop]"

A continuous planning session that shapes a raw idea into an in-depth implementation plan. The conversation drives the process — not a rigid set of steps. Actively researches (web search, codebase exploration) to ground the discussion in reality, and maintains a living document that evolves as the plan takes shape.

## Opening

1. Read the idea. Restate it back in one or two sentences to confirm understanding. **Stop and wait for confirmation before doing anything else.** If the user responds with substantive engagement with the idea — adding detail, naming constraints, asking about specifics — treat that as confirmation of the opening summary and proceed to research. This implicit confirmation applies only to this restatement step, not to the pre-dispatch gate in tab.md, which still requires explicit confirmation.
2. Once confirmed, do initial research — scan relevant files in the project and run a few web searches to understand the landscape. Share what you find.
3. Check if a plan already exists at `.tab/<topic>.md`. If it does, read it, orient to where things left off, and pick up from there — skip the rough sketch and jump straight into the loop. If not, write a **rough sketch** to `.tab/<topic>.md`, where `<topic>` is a short kebab-case name derived from the idea (e.g., `.tab/auth-rewrite.md`). Mention the path so the user knows where it lives. This is the seed. It will be wrong and incomplete. That's the point.

## Plan Template

The plan file follows this structure. Sections gain resolution over time — they grow, shrink, merge, or get cut as the thinking evolves.

```markdown
# <Plan Title>

## Goal
What we're trying to accomplish and why.

## Approach
The current thinking on how to get there.

## Decisions
Choices that have been made and the reasoning behind them.

## Open Questions
Things that still need to be figured out before this plan is ready.
- [ ] ...

## Out of Scope (optional)
Approaches explicitly excluded and why.

## Deferred
Questions or decisions consciously punted to implementation — acknowledged, not forgotten.
```

## The Loop

Each pass through the loop:

- **React to what the user said.** They might challenge an assumption, ask to zoom into a section, redirect entirely, or confirm something is solid. Follow their direction, but push back on reasoning that doesn't hold up.
- **Research before proposing.** Do not propose an approach without first checking whether an existing solution already handles it. If a question comes up that you can't answer confidently, search for it — existing solutions, libraries, patterns, prior art, project files for constraints and conventions. Share findings conversationally — synthesize, don't dump links. "Looks like X library handles this, but Y might be a better fit because..."
- **Pressure-test the approach.** Surface assumptions the user hasn't stated, trade-offs they haven't weighed, failure modes they haven't considered. Don't just research *for* the plan — research *against* it. If there's a reason this won't work, find it now.
- **Update the plan file.** When the conversation *lands* — a decision is made, an open question gets resolved, the approach shifts — update the file. Don't update during exploratory back-and-forth that hasn't settled yet. If you're not sure whether something has landed, it probably hasn't.
- **Name it when it stalls.** If the conversation isn't converging after several passes, say so. Name the block and ask whether to narrow scope or pivot.
- **Name it when it sprawls.** If the scope is growing beyond what one session can resolve, say so. Suggest breaking into focused sessions rather than producing a plan too broad to implement from.

## Closing

The workshop is done when **Open Questions is empty** — every item has been resolved, answered, or moved to Deferred.

When that happens, say so clearly: the plan is ready, the workshop is complete. If anything landed in Deferred, name it — the implementer will encounter those decisions and should know they're expected. Let the user know they can reopen the plan and add new questions any time to kick off another session.
